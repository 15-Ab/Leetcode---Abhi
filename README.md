## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The leaf sequence of a tree refers to the sequence of values encountered when performing a depth-first traversal and reaching a leaf node. My intuition is to compare the leaf sequences of both trees to check if they are identical.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Leaf Sequence Extraction :
- - My code defines two static lists (t1 and t2) to store the leaf values of the two trees.
- - Two helper methods (leaf1 and leaf2) are implemented to perform a depth-first traversal of each tree and populate the corresponding leaf lists.
- Leaf Traversal :
- - The 'leaf1' method traverses 'root1', identifies leaf nodes, and adds their values to the list 't1'.
- - Similarly, the 'leaf2' method traverses 'root2', identifies leaf nodes, and adds their values to the list 't2'.
- Comparison :
- - After both leaf lists are populated, the code compares the sizes of 't1' and 't2'.
- - If the sizes are different, the leaf sequences cannot be similar, and the code returns false.
- - If the sizes are the same, the code proceeds to compare each element of t1 with the corresponding element in t2.
- - If any pair of corresponding elements is not equal, the leaf sequences are not similar, and the code returns false.
- Result :
- - If the sizes and elements of t1 and t2 are equal, the leaf sequences are considered similar, and the code returns true.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)


# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- - $n$ : number of nodes

- Space complexity : $O(n + r)$

- - $r = max(h1, h2)$ ( since recursion stack is used for DFS trversal )
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- - $h1$ : height of tree 1 

- - $h2$ : height of tree 2
