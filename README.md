## 141. Linked List Cycle

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal is to determine whether a given linked list has a cycle or not. A cycle in a linked list occurs when a node points to a previously visited node, creating a loop in the structure.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Edge Case Check :**
   - Checked if the given linked list is empty (head is null). If it is, returned `false` as there can't be a cycle in an empty list.

**HashSet for Visited Nodes :**
   - Initialized a HashSet (`visitedNodes`) to keep track of visited nodes.
   - Added the head of the linked list to the HashSet.

**Traversed the Linked List :**
   - Used a while loop to traverse the linked list.
   - At each step, checked if the next node is already present in the HashSet. If it is, there is a cycle, so return `true`.
   - If the next node is not in the HashSet, added it to the HashSet.
   - Moved to the next node in the linked list.

**Result :**
   - If the loop completes without finding a cycle, returned `false`.

My approach utilized a HashSet to efficiently detect cycles in a linked list.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)
# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$N$ : number of nodes in the linked list
- Space complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
