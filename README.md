## 2971. Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem required finding the largest perimeter of a triangle from an array of integers. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its three sides. To maximize the perimeter, I to considered the largest possible combination of three sides from the given array.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Sorted the Array** 
- To consider the largest sides, I started by sorting the array in ascending order.

**Cumulative Sums** :
- Created an array (`h`) to store cumulative sums of the sorted elements. The cumulative sum represents the sum of all elements up to the current index.

**Iterated Through the Array** :
- Iterated through the sorted array, starting from the third element, as I need at least three elements to form a triangle. 
- For each element at index `i`, checked if the sum of the two smaller elements (`h[i-1]`) is greater than the current element (`nums[i]`). 
- If true, updated the `perimeter` with the maximum value between the current perimeter and the cumulative sum at index `i`.

**Return Result** :
- If a valid perimeter is found, returned the maximum perimeter; otherwise, returned -1.

My approach ensured that I consider the largest sides to maximize the perimeter of a valid triangle. Sorting the array helped in identifying the larger sides efficiently, and cumulative sums provided a quick way to calculate the sum of elements up to a certain index.
