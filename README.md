## 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem is to find the diameter of a binary tree, where the diameter is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. The path may or may not pass through the root.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
My code defined a `Solution` class with a static variable `maxDiameter` to store the maximum diameter encountered during traversal.

**Diameter Calculation Method (`diameterOfBinaryTree`) :**
   - This method is the entry point for calculating the diameter of the binary tree.
   - It resetted the `maxDiameter` variable to 0 before each calculation.
   - Called the `calculateMaxDepth` method to perform the traversal and update the `maxDiameter`.
   - Returned the final calculated diameter.

**Depth Calculation Method (`calculateMaxDepth`) :**
   - This method recursively calculated the maximum depth of the binary tree.
   - Base Case : If the current node is null, return 0.
   - Recursively calculated the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees.
   - Updated `maxDiameter` if the sum of left and right depths is greater than the current `maxDiameter`.
   - Returned the current node's depth (1 plus the maximum of left and right depths).

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)
# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$n$ : number of nodes in the binary tree
- Space complexity : $O(h)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$h$ : height of the binary tree

# Code
```
