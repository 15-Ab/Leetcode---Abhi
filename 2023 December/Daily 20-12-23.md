Sum up the first two chocolates

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Sorted the array
- The first two chocolates will have the least possible expenses
- Checked the sum of both prices with 'money'
- - if less than 'money' then simply return the leftover
- - else return the whole 'money' ( as asked )

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(logn)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int buyChoco(int[] prices, int money) {
        Arrays.sort(prices);
        // Checking the sum of both prices with 'money'
        // if less than 'money' then simply return the leftover
        //else return the whole 'money' ( as asked )
        if( prices[0] + prices[1] <= money){
            return money - ( prices[0] + prices[1] ) ;
        }
        else{
            return money;
        }

    }
