# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Simply checked for both type of patterns ( 0101.. and 1010.. )

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Simply checked for both type of patterns ( 0101.. and 1010.. )
- Variable 'a10' to store the number of changes required to make string of pattern '1010..'
- - Iterated whole string to find 'a10'
- Variable 'a01' to store the number of changes required to make string of pattern '0101..'
- Returned the minimum of 'a10' and 'a01'

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s) {
        int a10 = 0;  // to store changes required to make string of type '1010..'
        for( int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if( s.charAt(i) - '0' == i % 2){
                a10++;
            }
        }
        int a01;  // to store changes required to make string of type '0101..'
        a01 = s.length() - a10;
        return Math.min(a10, a01);
    }
}
