# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Flipped individual bits.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I created a 'answer' string
- Starting from first bit of first string
- - flipped it and added to 'answer'
- Done this for all indices
---
Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public String findDifferentBinaryString(String[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        String ans = "";
        // Flip individual bits so that answer string turns out to be unique
        for( int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int t = nums[i].charAt(i) - '0';
            if( t == 1){
                t = 0;
            }
            else{
                t = 1;
            }
            ans += (char)(t + '0');
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
