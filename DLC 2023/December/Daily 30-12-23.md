# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Basic unitary approach.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I stored characters with their number of occurences in a hashmap
- Checked if a character can be divided equally into all the strings or not
- - if no then return false ( as it cann't be divided equally to all strings present in the array)
- else return true

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(as)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
 $$a$$ : length of array
 $$s$$ : maximum length of any string
- Space complexity : $$O(c)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
 $$O(c)$$ : number of distinct characters in the array
# Code
```
class Solution {
    public boolean makeEqual(String[] words) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        // storing characters with their number of occurences in the hashmap
        for( int i = 0; i< words.length; i++){
            for( int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); j++){
                m.putIfAbsent(words[i].charAt(j), 0);
                m.put( words[i].charAt(j), m.get(words[i].charAt(j)) + 1 );
            }
        }
        // checking if a character can be divided equally into all the strings or not
        for( char c : m.keySet()){
            if( m.get(c) % words.length != 0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
