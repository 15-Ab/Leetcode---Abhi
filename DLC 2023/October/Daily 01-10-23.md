# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Reversing words one-by-one.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

- Created new string to store reversed string
- Firstly I kept start index at '0' as thats where first word will begin
- Then kept traversing until I found a space
- -  then I reversed the word that is nothing but substring from 'start' index to that index : and added to new string
- - put an extra space in new string
- - updated the start index

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(l*w)$$ = $$O(l)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(l*w)$$ = $$O(l)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$l$$ is the length of string.
$$w$$ is the length of largest word.

```
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {

        String rs = ""; // to store reversed string
        int start = 0; //starting index of current word
        for( int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if( s.charAt(i) == ' '){
                rs += reverseWord(s.substring(start,i));
                rs += " ";
                start = i + 1;
            }
            if( i == s.length() - 1){     // for last word : as there will not be any space after that
                rs += reverseWord(s.substring(start, s.length())); 
            }
        }
        return rs;
    }

    String reverseWord( String str){   // to reverse a single word
        String rw = ""; // to store reversed word
        for( int i = str.length()-1; i >= 0; i--){
            rw += str.charAt(i);
        }
        return rw;
    }
}
