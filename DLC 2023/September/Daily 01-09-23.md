# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Observing pattern after unitarily solving for few numbers.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
When done the unitary work :
0  --> 0
1  --> 1
2  --> 10
3  --> 11
4  --> 100
5  --> 101
6  --> 110
7  --> 111
8  --> 1000
9  --> 1001
10 --> 1010
11 --> 1011
12 --> 1100
13 --> 1101
14 --> 1110
15 --> 1111

Conclusion : 1's in binary representation of a number depended on representation of its half value and whether it is odd or even

- Created an array to store the number of 1's
- Assign number 0f 1's in a particular num to the number of 1's in (num/2)
- Further :
- - if num is't divisible by 2 then increment 1's count by 1
- - else no change
- Do for num = 0 to n

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(n)$$

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int a[] = new int[n+1];
        for( int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
            a[i] = a[i/2] + ( i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1) ;
        }
        return a;
    }
