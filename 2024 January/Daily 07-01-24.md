## 446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
An arithmetic slice is a sequence of elements in the array such that the difference between consecutive elements is the same.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialization :
- - I initialized the variable 'jawab' to keep track of the total number of arithmetic slices.
- Data Structures :
- - I created a 2D array gp to store the number of arithmetic slices. gp[i][j] represents the number of slices ending at index i with the last element at index j.
- - I have used a HashMap called 'map' to store indices of elements with the same value. This is done to efficiently find potential common differences.
- Populate the Map :
- - I iterated through the elements of the array (nums) and populate the map with indices of elements having the same value. The key is the element value, and the value is a list of indices.
- Dynamic Programming :
- - I iterated through each element in the array (nums) using two nested loops.
- - For each pair of indices (i, j) where i is the current index and j is less than i :
- - - Calculate the potential common difference l using the formula 2 * nums[j] - nums[i].
- - - Check if there are elements with value l in the map.
- - - If yes, iterate through the indices of elements with value l in the map:
- - - - For each index in, if j > in, update gp[i][j] by adding gp[j][in] + 1. This is because a new arithmetic slice is formed by extending the slice ending at index in.
- - - Accumulate the value of gp[i][j] to the overall answer jawab.
- Final Result :
- - The final answer is stored in the variable jawab.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(l^2)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity :  $$O(l^2)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
 $$l$$ : length of array.

class Solution {

        int jawab = 0; // Initialize the answer variable to 0
        int[][] gp = new int[nums.length][nums.length]; // 2D array to store the number of arithmetic slices
        Map<Long, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>(); // Map to store indices of elements with the same value

        // Populate the map with indices of elements having the same value
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            map.putIfAbsent(1L * nums[i], new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(1L * nums[i]).add(i);
        }

                long l = 2L * nums[j] - nums[i]; // Calculate the potential common difference

                // Check if there are elements in the map with the calculated common difference
                if (map.containsKey(l)) {
                    // Iterate through indices of elements with the calculated common difference
                    for (int in : map.get(l)) {
                        if (j > in) {
                            // Update the count of arithmetic slices in the 2D array
                            gp[i][j] += gp[j][in] + 1;
                        }
                    }
                }
                jawab += gp[i][j]; // Accumulate the count to the overall answer
            }
        }

        return jawab; // Return the final answer
    }
}
