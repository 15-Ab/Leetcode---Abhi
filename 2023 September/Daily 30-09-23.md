# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Storing middle element larger than both.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

I'm storing the candidate for being a middle element
I'll keep updating middle and left number ( with condition that middle > left ) until that number which is lesser than both comes

- Created a deque that will serve like a stack here
- Traversed array from last
- - if 'nums[i]' is found to be lesser than 'nums[k]'
- - - it means answer is found
- - else remove if smaller than 'nums[i]' 
- - - because I'm storing the number for the middle place and if any nums[i] is greater then that will become the middle one and come to deque

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

           // else remove all numbers which are smaller than 'nums[i]' // because I'm storing the number for the place of nums[j] and if any nums[i] is greater then that will become the member of list
           // basically I'm storing the candidate for being a middle element
           // I'll keep updating middle and left number until that number which is lesser than both comes
           while( !q.isEmpty() && nums[i] > q.peek() ){
               nk = q.pop();

            q.push(nums[i]);
