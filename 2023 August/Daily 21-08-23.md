# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Whether by hit-n-trial or any other means, this method was developed.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Let a new string which is just two original string joined end-to-end.
- Remove first and last element of new string.
- If after removal, original string can be viewed in that, then returns true.
- Otherwise, false

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n^2)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public boolean repeatedSubstringPattern(String s) {
        String ss = s + s;
        return ss.substring(1, ss.length() - 1).contains(s);
    }
}
