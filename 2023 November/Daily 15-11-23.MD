# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Sort and edit.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I sorted the array
- If first element isn't '1' then make it '1'
- Starting with second element compare with previous element
- If difference is more than 1 then reduce it to just 1 greater than previous element 
- - since maximum possible element is to be discovered
---
Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$sort$$ 
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Java Arrays.sort() takes : $$O(n)$$ or $$O(n*logn)$$

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        // If first element isn't '1' then make it '1'
        if( arr[0] != 1){
            arr[0] = 1;
        }
        // Starting with second element compare with previous element 
        // If difference is more than 1 then reduce it to just 1 greater than previous element (since maximum possible element is to be discovered )
        for( int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
            if( arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 1){
                arr[i] = arr[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return arr[arr.length-1];
    }
}
