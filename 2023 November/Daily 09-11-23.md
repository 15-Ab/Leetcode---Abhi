# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Applied unitary method.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Remember : 
- Given array is said to be strictly increasing.
- We cann't go to next number before accessing its smaller one
- We can 'Push' and 'Pop'

My approach : 
- Variable 'prev' will store the expected number that should come after that, if target[i] is 5 then target[i+1] is expected to be 6 : as stream of number means
- I initialised 'prev' as '1' as number stream will start from 1
- At each iteration I matched with corresponding target[] value
- - if matches then simply 'Push'
- - otherwise in order to reach given target[] value : 'Push' and 'Pop' the intermediate numbers

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$

# Code
```
class Solution {

        List<String> l = new ArrayList<>();

        int prev = 1;
        for(int p = 0; p < target.length; p++){
            if(target[p] == prev){
                l.add("Push");
            }   
            else{
                for( int i = prev; i < target[p]; i++){
                    l.add("Push");
                    l.add("Pop");
                }
                l.add("Push");
            }
            prev = target[p]+1;
        }
        return l;
    }
